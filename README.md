# Breaker
breaker game capstone project

My capstone project is a brick breaker game in which you try to break all the bricks with a paddle and ball

I used the basic framework of a viewer, frame, and component class. Some new concepts I used are break statements and different listeners.

ball bounce pseudocode:

  if ball hits board
  
    >calculate ratio of ball distance from paddle center to total center distance
    
    >find x with sin
    
    >find y with cos
    
    >reverse x
    
>Instructions:

  run main method of viewer class
  
  move mouse to move paddle
  
  play game
